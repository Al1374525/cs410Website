                The challenge is the isolation and difficulty that Gamers
                face in discovering new titles, while lacking a dedicated platform to connect with like-minded players.

                Many Gamers find it hard to explore new games and build a community around their gaming interests,
                leading to a sense of disconnection in an increasingly vast and diverse gaming landscape.
